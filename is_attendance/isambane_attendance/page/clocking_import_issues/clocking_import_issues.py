"""
Clocking Import Issues - a central page for the two kinds of "clocking
data isn't quite right yet" gaps that used to only be visible one document
(or one machine record) at a time:

- **Unresolved employee codes**: every badge/PIN number that doesn't match
  any Employee.attendance_device_id, aggregated *across every Draft
  Clocking Import document* rather than shown per-document - the same
  code routinely shows up as an Issue on many separate daily import files
  (a whole month's worth, until someone maps it), so finding and fixing
  it from one place instead of hunting through documents one at a time is
  the entire point of this page. Resolving a code here does exactly what
  resolving it on any one document's own Issues table already does
  (assign_employee_code/resync_drafts_for_codes in
  is_attendance.controllers.clocking_import) - this page doesn't
  reimplement that, it's a different, doctype-agnostic entry point into
  the same mechanism. Employee pickers can be set on as many rows as
  needed before resolving anything - resolve_employee_codes_bulk() then
  assigns every pair that has one set in a single action, rather than one
  round trip per code. The actual Employee.attendance_device_id writes
  happen inline (fast), but resyncing every Draft document affected is
  queued as a background job (resync_drafts_for_codes_job) rather than
  done inline - resyncing means a full re-save of each one, and a bulk
  resolve touching several large documents at once was timing out the
  request when that ran synchronously.
- **Incomplete Clocking Machines**: every IS Attendance Clocking Machine
  record with no Branch set - the one piece of missing device
  information with a real functional consequence (see
  clocking_machine_branch_map()), so these can be filled in from one
  place instead of opening each device's own record to notice it's
  missing.

export_exceptions_excel() gives both tables as one .xlsx (two sheets) for
anyone who needs an offline copy or has to hand it to someone without
Desk access - same underlying queries as the page itself, not a separate
report to keep in sync.
