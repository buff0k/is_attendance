"""
Clocking export import - accepts every clocking export shape this app
knows about (gateway.py's own HIKVision recordList CSV, a tolerated legacy
CSV variant, and the legacy tab-separated .DAT export) through one
doctype. Which shape a given file is gets sniffed from its own content the
moment it's parsed (see is_attendance.controllers.clocking_parsers'
detect_and_parse/sniff_format) - the person uploading never has to know or
choose in advance, and the result is recorded on this doc's own
detected_format field so it's always visible, not implicit.

This doctype used to be split across "Clocking DAT Import" and "Clocking
CSV Import" (formerly "Clocking HIKVision Import"), which differed only in
which parser parse_file() called - every other part of the pipeline
(Issues tracking, the Draft -> Missing Information -> Pending Import ->
Importing -> Completed/Error lifecycle, create_checkins,
sync_clocking_machines) was already fully shared. Consolidating removes
that duplication permanently: a future new vendor shape is "add one more
parse_*() function to clocking_parsers.py," never "clone this doctype
again."

See is_attendance.controllers.clocking_import's module docstring for the
full narrative on *why* the pipeline is shaped the way it is (background
job, before_submit guard, etc.) - that module is what actually drives
every method below; this file only owns doctype registration and handing
the attached file to the right parser.
