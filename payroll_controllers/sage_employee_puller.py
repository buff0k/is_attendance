"""
sage_employee_puller.py - a heartbeat that polls Frappe for pending Sage
employee-pull requests and, for each one it can serve, queries Sage VIP
Premier directly (its own Windows ODBC DSNs, e.g. "VIP_Company001") for
that Company Number's active employee list and posts the result back into
the requesting Sage Payroll Run.

Runs continuously on the Windows PC that already has the VIP_Company00N
ODBC DSNs configured for the existing Excel/VBA payroll tooling - Sage's
DSNs aren't reachable from the Linux Frappe bench, same reason gateway.py/
erp_uploader.py already live here as separate Windows-side scripts (see
../clocking_controllers/README_CON.md for that same pattern, and this
folder's own README_CON.md for this script's).

Frappe never talks to Sage directly and this script never runs unprompted
against Sage - the trigger always starts on the Frappe side: a person
clicks "Request Employee Pull" on a Sage Payroll Run (sets its Status to
"Pull Requested"), and this heartbeat's next poll of
list_pending_pull_requests() is what notices and actually does the ODBC
work. Nothing here decides on its own which Runs need pulling.

Frappe's own Sage Payroll Company record is the sole source of truth for
which Paypoints belong to a Company Number. The DSN-per-Company mapping
used to live in this script's own local config too, but now lives on this
controller's own Sage Remote Controller record in Frappe instead (fetched
fresh every cycle via get_remote_controller_config, identified by which
User this script's api_key/api_secret belong to) - the local config file
now holds only what Frappe genuinely has no business knowing: how to reach
this Frappe site and authenticate (base_url/api_key/api_secret), and how
often to poll. This means a newly-enabled Company/edited DSN needs no
redeploy or restart on the Windows host at all, and the "Connected
controllers" summary on that doctype's own list view is always current.

The query and connection shape below were extracted directly from the real
Salary Sheet .xls files this integration was reverse-engineered from - a
byte search of the OLE binary turned up the exact embedded MS Query
definition Excel itself was running:

    SELECT EMP_INFO_FIXED.Surname AS 'SURNAME', EMP_INFO_FIXED.EmployeeCode AS 'COY',
           EMP_INFO_FIXED.FullNames AS 'NAME', EMP_INFO_FIXED.IDNumber AS 'ID',
           DESC_JOBTITLE.JobTitleLongDesc AS 'OCCUPATION'
    FROM dba.DESC_JOBTITLE DESC_JOBTITLE, dba.EMP_INFO_FIXED EMP_INFO_FIXED
    WHERE EMP_INFO_FIXED.JobTitleCode = DESC_JOBTITLE.JobTitleCode
      AND ((EMP_INFO_FIXED.PaypointCode = ?) AND (EMP_INFO_FIXED.EmployeeStatus = 'N'))
    ORDER BY EMP_INFO_FIXED.Surname, DESC_JOBTITLE.JobTitleLongDesc

    DSN=VIP_Company001;UID=;PWD=;

Only identity columns are proven to be sourced this way - no embedded
query for hours baselines, allowances, or leave balances was found
anywhere in the real files, so this script (and the Frappe-side DocType it
feeds) deliberately doesn't attempt to pull those; Normal/Overtime/Leave
hours are computed on the Frappe side from our own Employee Checkin and
Leave Application data instead (see is_attendance.controllers.sage_payroll).

Needs `pyodbc` and `requests` installed, and the same Sybase SQL Anywhere
/ iAnywhere ODBC driver the existing VBA tooling already depends on (no
new driver install implied - if the Excel query tool works on this PC,
the DSN already works).
